# Ubuntu setup

I was tired of writing complicated scripts so I made this one massive continuous one that works for ubuntu and is a forward considerate as I care to be.

## Getting Started

Run 'sudo bash setup.sh' and follow the prompts. Most things are not passed flags because your a dope who will miss something if I dont make you look.

## How to backup

Currently incomplete. Make an instruction in setup to make alias for config backup. .sh script copies all dotfiles we know to care about.
